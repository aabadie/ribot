### Firmware code for CoAP control mode

This is the code for controlling RiBot via bluetooth. This firmware is built
on top of [RIOT](http://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).

Even if the code supports the Nucleo-F446 board with an XBee module, prefer
using the Atmel SAMR21 board (successfuly tested on this board).
